“All right. Old man didn't intend to kill, arrowheads were smeared with curare. Soon fighters will recover. How it goes, Sĩtrĭs?”
“Wonderful, Kchárăs, as it should to go,” Sĩtrĭs responded. “Send everyheart to sleep, Līkchmås and Chhånêi are far-far away.”
Silence. I just heard a grindstone rolling and creaking inside warchief's head.
“Tchu, the altar is crying of you rotten fish,” Kchárăs grumbled without any malice and came in stamping loudly.

“Amazing,” Griswold declared gasping for air. “I’ve never been in such stupid situation. So, let’s act a play to the end.”
Griswold came closer to Lucifer and bowed as well as both fast walk and heavy load permitted to do.
“I’m Griswold, belong to… mmm… Griswold house. Hand of Gris for elbow grease.”
Boy gave a ceremonious nod to fatty.
“I belong to Hanayama house,” the boy told. “Noble skin is the best suit.”

“You did have no roots and no teachers.
You will have no scions and no followers.
Here is no indeterminacy leading to nascence of you.
Here will be no quantum keeping a memory of you.
You never existed and never will.”

“Hell, you will pay. Wind-Curling-Hair was murdered by you. Hell, you will pay.”

Am Dm
The time will come, my little breeze,
G D
You will be strong as ground is,
F G Em Am
It carries mountains, it carries coloured cay.

F C
You'll catch the flying serpent's barbs,
G Am
And you will soar among the stars
F E (Em) Am (A)
To noble roots, to native faraway.

But not today, my ringing cord,
I shelter you from skies of cold
With slender fingers weaved of gentle speech,

And if the ground breaks and rolls,
And if the skies to darkness fall,
My gentle arms will never ever flinch.
